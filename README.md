# myKinopoisk

My apps is created for movies fans. You can find TOP movies, add movies to your favorites. Also you can open movies descriptions.

Features:
1. Sign in with your credentials or like a guest.
2. Choose tab: popular movies or your favorites movies
3. If you want to add movie to favorites use long click. Do you want to delete? The same long click.
4. Click on movie for openning detailed description.

Techologies:
1. The source is the unofficial Kinopoisk API. You can sign in like a guest or you can sign up on https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/ and then use your credentials for signing in. I use Retrofit 2 for REST API.
2. You can storage your favorites film on your phone. I use Room for local storage.
3. MVVM architecture.
4. I use private shared preferences for storaging your credentials.





The app is still developing. I have big TODO list :)
